                <p>
                    Genshin Impact is an action role-playing game developed and published by miHoYo. It was released for
                    Microsoft Windows, Playstation 4, iOS, and Android in 2020, and on Playstation 5 in 2021. The game
                    is also set for release on Nintendo Switch.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Genshin Impact takes place in the fantasy world of Teyvat, which is home to seven distinct nations,
                    each of which is tied to a different element and ruled by a different god. The story follows the
                    Traveler, who has traveled across countless worlds with their twin sibling before becoming separated
                    in Teyvat. The Traveler travels in search of the lost sibling with their companion Paimon and
                    becomes involved in the affairs of Teyvat's nations.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Development began in 2017 and is currently ongoing. The game received generally positive reviews,
                    with critics praising the game's combat mechanics and open-world immersiveness, but criticized its
                    simplistic endgame and monetization model. A commercial success, the game grossed more than $3
                    billion in its first year of release, the highest ever first-year launch revenue for any video game.
